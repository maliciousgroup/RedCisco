# RedCisco

This tool was part of a blog post (https://blog.malicious.group/redcisco-red-team-tool-development/) about writing your own tools for offensive security engagements.  If you want to know how the tool was developed, follow the blog.  It is about a 18 minute read, but contains everything you would need to tool just like it.
